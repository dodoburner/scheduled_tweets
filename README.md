Thing that I learned:

VIEWS
- Partials are like components in react

ROUTES
- You can rename url names but have the same path name using "as: :whatever"

FLASHES
- You can declare flashes as a hash in the controller to display
- You can use flash.now to have it show up only once

DEBUGGIN
- You can use .inspect to debug variables
